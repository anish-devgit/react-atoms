**Component**
Which component or page? (eg. `Flux Text`, `Orbital Fluids`)

**Issue**
What happens in the live preview? e.g. "preview area shows 'Preview not available'"

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Go to /components/...
2. Click Preview tab
3. Observe

**Expected**
Preview auto-plays, matches usage, and re-triggers on hover.

**Notes**
Add screenshot or browser console logs.
