## 🧠 What is ReactAtoms?

**ReactAtoms** is a high-performance, animation-first React component system built for modern interfaces.

It's not a UI kit.  
It's not a design system.  

It's a **motion-driven component engine** designed for:
- landing pages
- SaaS dashboards
- creative portfolios
- next-gen web experiences

Every component is **atomic**, **copy-pasteable**, and **independent**.

No wrappers.  
No lock-in.  
No bloat.

---

## ⚡ Why ReactAtoms exists

Most UI libraries:
- look the same
- animate poorly
- hide logic behind abstractions

ReactAtoms is different.

We focus on:
- **motion physics**
- **visual depth**
- **interaction feedback**
- **developer control**

If you care about *how things feel*, not just how they look — this is for you.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🧬 Atomic Components
Each component works standalone.  
Use one, use ten, or use all — your call.

### 🎨 Advanced Text Animations
Entropy decoding, magnetic focus, glitch distortion, aurora plasma, cinematic reveals.

### 🌌 Immersive Background Systems
Canvas-based particles, gravity wells, fluid orbits, grid warping, noise & meshes.

### ⚡ Micro-Interactions
Buttons, toggles, cards, hover states, loading effects — all motion-aware.

### 🧠 Motion-First Architecture
Built on **Framer Motion** with real physics (springs, inertia, damping).

### 🛠 TypeScript-First
Strict typing. Predictable APIs. Editor autocomplete that actually helps.

### 🎛 Tailwind-Native
Fully customizable via utility classes — no fighting the library.

---

## 📦 Installation

ReactAtoms components are dependency-light and framework-agnostic.

```bash
npm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

No custom CLI.  
No package lock-in.  
Copy only what you need.

## 🚀 Quick Example

```tsx
import { FluxText } from "@/components/text/FluxText";

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <FluxText
      text="ReactAtoms"
      intensity={0.8}
      hover
    />
  );
}
```
