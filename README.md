## ✨ What is ReactAtoms?

**ReactAtoms** is a curated collection of atomic, copy-paste-ready React components designed to help developers build visually striking interfaces without reinventing the wheel.

Every component is:
- visually expressive
- performance-aware
- easy to customize
- independent (no lock-in)

Built for developers who care about **motion, polish, and details**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **🧬 Atomic by Design**  
  Each component is standalone and reusable — plug only what you need.

- **🎨 Advanced Text Animations**  
  Quantum focus, entropy decoding, glitch effects, aurora text, mist reveals, and more.

- **🌌 Immersive Backgrounds**  
  Canvas-based particle systems, orbital physics, gradient meshes, grid vortices.

- **⚡ Micro-Interactions**  
  Buttons, toggles, cards, hover effects, loading states, subtle motion details.

- **🧠 Motion-First Architecture**  
  Built with Framer Motion for smooth, physics-based animations.

- **🛠 TypeScript First**  
  Fully typed components with predictable APIs.

- **🎛 Tailwind CSS Friendly**
